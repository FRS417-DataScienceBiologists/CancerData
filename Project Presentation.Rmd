##Background
- Over 1.5 million cancer cases diagnosed in the US each year
- Darthmouth Atlas Project report
- Examining elderly cancer patients across the country
- Poor prognosis patients

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("PPT_IMG_1.jpg")
```



## Load the tidyverse 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Retrieve data from Excel
```{r}
Cancer <-
readr::read_csv("DAP_cancer_events_hosp_2010.csv", 
                na = c("", " ", "NA", "#N/A", "-999", "\\"))
Cancer
```

## Briefly analyze data and look for NAs
```{r}
glimpse(Cancer)
```

## Load skimr
```{r}
library(skimr)
```

## Use the Skim function
```{r}
Cancer %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

## Had to use select to exclude "X17-20". They skewed my NA value. 
```{r}
CancerNEW <- Cancer %>%
  select(`Provider ID`, `Hospital Name`, City, State, `Number of deaths among cancer patients assigned to hospital (2010)`, `Percent of cancer patients dying in hospital (2010)`, `Percent of cancer patients admitted to hospital during the last month of life (2010 deaths)`, `Percent of cancer patients admitted to intensive care during the last month of life (2010 deaths)`, `ICU days per cancer patient during the last month of life (2010 deaths)`, `Percent of cancer patients receiving life-sustaining treatment during the last month of life (2010 deaths)`, `Percent of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the last two weeks of life (2010 deaths)`, `Percent of cancer patients enrolled in hospice during the last month of life (2010 deaths)`, `Percent of cancer patients enrolled in hospice during the last three days of life (2010 deaths)`, `Percent of cancer patients seeing ten or more physicians during the last six months of life (2010 deaths)`,`HIV Related` )
CancerNEW
```


## What are the names we are working with?
```{r}
names(Cancer)  
```
#these names aren't great

## Renaming the data 
```{r}
CancerName <- CancerNEW %>%
dplyr::rename( Deaths_in_hospital = "Number of deaths among cancer patients assigned to hospital (2010)", 
               Percent_death = "Percent of cancer patients dying in hospital (2010)", 
percent_admitted_LM = "Percent of cancer patients admitted to hospital during the last month of life (2010 deaths)", 
percent_admitted_ICU_LM = "Percent of cancer patients admitted to intensive care during the last month of life (2010 deaths)", 
Avg_ICU_Days_LM = "ICU days per cancer patient during the last month of life (2010 deaths)", 
Percent_receiving_LStreatment_LM = "Percent of cancer patients receiving life-sustaining treatment during the last month of life (2010 deaths)", 
Percent_receiving_chemo_L2W = "Percent of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy during the last two weeks of life (2010 deaths)", 
Percent_Hospice_LM = "Percent of cancer patients enrolled in hospice during the last month of life (2010 deaths)", 
Percent_Hospice_L3D = "Percent of cancer patients enrolled in hospice during the last three days of life (2010 deaths)", 
Percent_seeing_10ormoreMDs_L6M = "Percent of cancer patients seeing ten or more physicians during the last six months of life (2010 deaths)")
CancerName
```
## These are much better
```{r}
names(CancerName)
```


## How many NAs are in our data?
```{r}
CancerName %>%
  summarize(number_na=sum(is.na(CancerName)))
```

## Where are these NAs Located?
```{r}
  CancerName %>%
  purrr::map_df(~sum(is.na(.))) %>%
  tidyr::gather(key="variables", value="num_nas") %>% 
  arrange(desc(num_nas))
```

## We have a ton of NAs. Majority of these come from the the variables shown in the previous slide.

## Highest death rate by State
```{r}
CancerName %>%
  select(State, Percent_death) %>%
  arrange(desc(Percent_death))
```
##Percent Death by Top 3 States
```{r eval=FALSE}
CancerName %>%
  group_by(State) %>% 
  filter(State %in% c("NY", "NJ", "IN")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=State, y=Percent_death))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Percent Death by Top 3 States",
       y = "% Death")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

##Boxplot
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
CancerName %>%
  group_by(State) %>% 
  filter(State %in% c("NY", "NJ", "IN")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=State, y=Percent_death))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Percent Death by Top 3 States",
       y = "% Death")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

## Lowest death rate by State
```{r}
CancerName %>%
  select(State, Percent_death) %>%
  arrange(Percent_death)
```

##Percent Death by Top and Bottom States
```{r eval=FALSE}
CancerName %>%
  group_by(State) %>% 
  filter(State %in% c("NY", "FL")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=State, y=Percent_death))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Percent Death by Top and Bottom States",
       y = "% Death")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

##Boxplot
```{r, echo=FALSE}

  labs(title = "Percent Death by Top and Bottom States",
       y = "% Death")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust = 0.5))
```

## Focusing strictly on HIV related cases 
```{r}
CancerHIV <- CancerName %>%
  filter(`HIV Related`=="HIV")
CancerHIV
```

## What's the average deaths per state for HIV cases 
```{r}
CancerHIV_2 <-CancerHIV %>%
  select(City, State, Deaths_in_hospital) %>%
  filter(!State=="NA") %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(
    State_mean = mean(Deaths_in_hospital)) %>%
  arrange(desc(State_mean))
CancerHIV_2
```

## How does this look on a plot? 
```{r eval=FALSE}
CancerHIV_2 %>% 
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(State, State_mean), y=State_mean, fill=State)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", alpha=1) +
  labs(title = "Number of Cancer-related deaths caused by HIV (State)", 
       x= "State", 
       y= " Numner of deaths") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray 50")) +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust= 0.5)) 
```

```


## Does that mean IL, or competing states, are the worst state to treat cancer cases caused by HIV?
```{r}
CancerHIV_3<- CancerHIV %>%
  select(City, State, Percent_death, `HIV Related`) %>% 
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarize(State_mean_percent_death=mean(Percent_death))
CancerHIV_3
```
## Let's see
```{r eval=FALSE}
CancerHIV_3 %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(State,State_mean_percent_death), y= State_mean_percent_death, fill=State)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", alpha=1) +
    labs(title = "Percent death of admitted HIV patients (State)", 
       x= "State", 
       y= " Percent of death") + 
  theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray 50")) +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust= 0.5)) 
```

## Let's see

    theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "gray 50")) +
   theme(plot.title = element_text(size = rel(1.5), hjust= 0.5)) 
```

## Here we clearly see that the top 10 of previous plot are drastically different from these


## Let's see how the top 5 states from the previous plot compare to their "Regular" case's data?
```{r}

CancerHIV_3 <- CancerHIV_3 %>%
   filter(State== "DC"| State== "OK" |State== "NY" |State== "AL"| State== "CA" ) 

CancerHIV_3$HIV_related<-c('HIV','HIV','HIV','HIV','HIV')
CancerHIV_3
```

```{r}

```
## Continued
```{r}

Cancer_reg_mean
```
## Continued
```{r}

Cancer_matix <- rbind(Cancer_reg_mean,CancerHIV_3)

```
## HIV-Death percents vs Regular-death percents (States)
```{r eval=FALSE}
Cancer_matix %>%
